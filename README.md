## Overview

This is a BoardGameArena (BGA) implementation of the **Yacht Rock** board game by Prospero Hall. Players take on the role of 1970s soft rock musicians in Southern California, scoring points over three rounds by creating swanky outfits, recording hit songs, and attending schmoozy parties.
